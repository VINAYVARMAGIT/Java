There are 4 properties of that are in the OOPS concept of java:
They are:
1.Inheritance
2.Polymorphism
3.Abstraction
4.Encapsulaton

INHERITANCE:
-The subclass inherits all the properties(data members,member properties) from the super class 
-We use extends keyword to extends the super class properties  


-If we have a super class with some varibales and is initialized in the constructer but when we create a ref type of varaible of a sub class 
and create a object of the super class where we initialize the variables of the super class one's when trying to acess the sub class variables the 
class doesn't call and throws an error as it doesn't have a any where the varaible is initialized 

Multiple Inheritance doesn't happen in this as it wil have ambiguity problem
